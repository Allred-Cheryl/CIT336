 <main><h1>Site Plan</h1></main>
 <p>Website for aspiring music geeks</p>
     <p>Description
<br>1) PadawanComposer.com
<br>2) I have developed a sight to share Spencer Allred's music.<br>Visitors can listen to music and watch videos.<br>It’ll also have links to other sites.<br>
Unlike other sites, this one is free.
What music would you make?
<br>3) My target audience not only likes music but more specifically making music.<br>They come from all economic ranges, but more likely they are from lower socio economic statuses.<br>Education also varies as does age.<br>The range is from older children to people in their fifties.<br>
<br>4) Persona
<a href="Persona.pdf">Persona</a>
<br>5) Scenario: Where can I learn more about the artist</p>
