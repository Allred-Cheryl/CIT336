This week I worked on inserting audio using html. Here's an example
<audio controls>


<source src="http://www.scpc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/come_thou_fount.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>


I also learned how to allow users to upload audio. Here is an example.


<form action="demo_form.asp">
<input type="file" name="audio" accept="audio/*">
<input type="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
